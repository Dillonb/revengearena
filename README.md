Revenge Arena
=============
A custom game mode for various Source Engine based games.
---------------------------------------------------------

This is a game mode inspired by revenge dodgeball. Remember gym class? For now, it is compatible only with TF2, but CS:S compatibility is planned. Right now I have no plans to support other games, but more may be added upon request. I'd like it if it was a GitHub pull request.

This mod requires SourceMod installed and configured. The console variable revengearena_enabled must be set to 1 for the plugin to function. In addition, in TF2, the map *must* be of the arena type.
